# DevOps Project Repository

This repository contains a collection of essential tools, configurations, and scripts to manage and deploy infrastructure using Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform. The repository is structured into multiple directories for better organization and usability.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **K8S**
This folder contains Kubernetes configuration files and manifests. These files define the deployment, services, config maps, and other Kubernetes objects to manage containerized applications.

- **Deployments**: Kubernetes manifests for deploying applications.
- **Services**: YAML files for exposing applications to the network.
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Application configuration and sensitive data management.

### 2. **public**
This directory includes static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files required for the web interface of the application.

### 3. **src**
This is the source code folder for the application. It contains the core code for the services or apps you are building.

### 4. **terraform**
The `terraform` folder consists of Terraform configuration files for infrastructure automation. This includes defining cloud resources, setting up networks, deploying instances, and managing other infrastructure services.

- **main.tf**: Main configuration file to define the infrastructure.
- **variables.tf**: Variables used in the Terraform configurations.
- **outputs.tf**: Defines the output values of the Terraform setup.

### 5. **.gitignore**
Specifies the files and directories to be ignored by Git, including sensitive information, environment files, and system files.

### 6. **Dockerfile**
The `Dockerfile` defines the containerization setup of your application, specifying how the app will be built and run inside a Docker container.

### 7. **package-lock.json & package.json**
These files define the dependencies for the Node.js-based application, specifying the libraries and tools required to run the project.

### 8. **terraform.tfstate**
The Terraform state file that keeps track of the current infrastructure state managed by Terraform. This file should not be manually edited and is important for Terraform's operation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the directory with the `Dockerfile` and build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

### 3. Run the Application
Once the Docker image is built, you can run the container with:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 your_image_name
```

### 4. Apply Terraform Configurations
Navigate to the `terraform` directory and initialize Terraform:

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 5. Deploy on Kubernetes
Navigate to the `K8S` folder and apply the Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- Integrate logging solutions like ELK or Loki.
